# 🚗 Uarrivo/Matestanash App

**Uarrivo** is a car-reservation application inspired by Uber, developed in C++ using the Qt framework. Built as a team project in the **Fundamentals of Computing II** course at the **American University in Cairo** (2020), the app demonstrates object-oriented design, algorithmic problem-solving, and practical GUI development.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Team Size:** 3 students  
- **Role:** Team Lead and Developer  
- **Technologies:** C++, Qt  
- **Routing Algorithm:** Dijkstra’s Algorithm  

Uarrivo efficiently calculates the fastest routes, handles user authentication, and simulates a complete ride-hailing experience with features like multiple car types and payment options.

## ✨ Features

- 🚘 **Car Classes**  
  Different ride options with variable pricing (e.g. Economy, Premium).

- 💳 **Multiple Payment Methods**  
  Users can store and select preferred payment options.

- 🔐 **Authentication System**  
  Sign-up and sign-in functionality with input validation.

- 👤 **User Profile Management**  
  Users can update their age, phone number, and payment details.

- 🗺️ **Optimized Routing**  
  Utilizes Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest/fastest route.

## 🧱 Architecture & Design

Uarrivo was developed using a modular, object-oriented approach:

- Designed UML class diagrams and separated logic into modules.
- Used Qt for GUI and event-driven architecture.
- Divided responsibilities among team members for effective collaboration.

### Development Workflow

1. **Design Phase**  
   - Object-oriented system architecture
   - UI mockups using Qt Designer

2. **Implementation Phase**  
   - Core features divided and implemented by individual team members
   - Integrated into a cohesive working application

3. **Testing & Debugging**  
   - Manual scenario testing
   - Route and input validation checks
